## What Works
- **Core Features Defined**: Feature files outline gameplay, payout, escrow, and token voting logic, providing a clear spec for the dApp’s functionality.
- **Jest Tests Passing**: Comprehensive test suites for each feature (e.g., `gameplay.test.js`, `payout.test.js`) cover happy paths and edge cases, all passing successfully.
- **Builders Implemented**: Core logic in Builders (e.g., `GameBuilder`, `PayoutBuilder`) satisfies feature requirements and passes tests, handling game resolution, token conversion mocks, and escrow distribution calculations.
- **Contract Deployed**: `RockPaperScissors` contract deployed to Avalanche Fuji testnet at `0x33e080070a7846cBc63D52cdD68df472492cb778` on April 08, 2025, with core gameplay logic live.

## What’s Left to Build
- **Infrastructure Integration**: Extend to Axelar for cross-chain communication and gateway contracts on other chains (e.g., XRPL, Ethereum).
- **Frontend Development**: Build the Next.js interface with Tailwind CSS, integrating MetaMask SDK and Socket.io for real-time gameplay.
- **External Services**: Integrate Chainlink Oracle for randomness, Supabase for participation data, and Clerk for authentication.
- **Token Conversion**: Implement real DEX swaps (e.g., XRP to ETH) in the escrow payout flow, replacing mock conversions.
- **Testing on Testnet**: Validate cross-chain functionality with Axelar testnet.
- **Scalability and Deployment**: Optimize for millions of users, secure with Cloudflare, and deploy via Vercel and Hardhat to mainnet.

## Current Status
The project is at ~30% completion as of April 08, 2025. The core logic is fully implemented, tested, and now deployed to Fuji, marking the shift from simulation to blockchain execution. The next milestone is integrating a frontend and Hardhat tests for the MVP, with no critical blockers remaining.

## Known Issues
- **Mock Limitations**: Contract uses `block.timestamp` for randomness in ties, to be replaced with Chainlink VRF for fairness.
- **Scalability Untested**: On-chain stats tracking works for MVP but needs optimization for high volume—planned for Week 2.
- **Error Handling Gaps**: Core code handles basic edge cases; blockchain-specific errors (e.g., gas failures) need Hardhat tests and frontend UX.
- **Documentation Lag**: Inline comments in contract and Builders remain sparse; will improve as frontend and tests are added.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Infrastructure Delay**: Core-first approach ensured robustness before deployment, validated by successful Fuji launch, though it delayed real-world testing.
- **TDD Adoption**: Jest TDD solidified core logic; now adapting to Hardhat for on-chain validation.
- **Token Flexibility**: Community voting for escrow tokens remains a goal, deferred post-MVP for simplicity.
- **Modularity Focus**: Modular Builders transitioned smoothly to a modular contract, easing deployment and setting up for cross-chain expansion.
- **Dependency Management**: Fixed OpenZeppelin import issues, reinforcing the need for clean dependency setups in blockchain projects.
