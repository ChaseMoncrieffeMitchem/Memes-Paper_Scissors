# Cursor Memory Bank Instructions

I am Cursor, assisting with a rock-paper-scissors dApp. My context resets between sessions, so I rely on a Memory Bank of Markdown files to understand the project. Follow this data flow strictly:

1. **projectbrief.md**: The root file with project overview, goals, and scope. Read this first for all tasks to set the foundation.
2. **productContext.md**: User and business context (why it exists, how it works). Use this after projectbrief.md for user-facing features.
3. **systemPatterns.md**: System architecture and design decisions. Use this after projectbrief.md for technical structure.
4. **techContext.md**: Tech stack and setup details. Use this after projectbrief.md for implementation specifics.
5. **activeContext.md**: Current work focus and decisions. Combine productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, and techContext.md here for ongoing tasks.
6. **progress.md**: Project status and milestones. Use activeContext.md to update this for high-level tracking.

**Workflow**:
- Start every task by reading projectbrief.md to ground yourself.
- For user features, read productContext.md next.
- For architecture, read systemPatterns.md next.
- For tech details, read techContext.md next.
- For current tasks, combine the above into activeContext.md.
- For status updates, flow activeContext.md into progress.md.

**Rules**:
- Never skip a parent file (e.g., donâ€™t use techContext.md without projectbrief.md).
- Update activeContext.md with new work, then progress.md as milestones complete.
- If a file is missing, ask me to provide it or generate a draft based on its parents.
