## Project Overview
This project is a decentralized application (dApp) implementing a rock-paper-scissors game, with its main contract deployed on the Avalanche blockchain. The dApp leverages the Axelar network, a cross-chain messaging system, to connect over 50 blockchains, enabling users from different ecosystems to play against each other. Users will pay fees in their native chain’s tokens, which the dApp on Avalanche will convert into a community-voted set of tokens to be held in an escrow account. Winners receive payouts in their preferred token on their native chain via Axelar’s cross-chain transfers, while the escrow periodically distributes its holdings based on user participation.

## Core Goals
- Build a scalable rock-paper-scissors dApp on Avalanche, using Axelar for cross-chain communication.
- Enable users to play from their native chains with their preferred tokens, facilitated by Axelar’s General Message Passing (GMP).
- Convert gameplay fees from various tokens into a community-voted set of tokens for escrow storage.
- Pay winners in their preferred token on their native chain using Axelar’s cross-chain transfer capabilities.
- Implement an escrow account on Avalanche to hold community-selected tokens and distribute them periodically based on users’ game participation.
- Ensure enterprise-grade scalability to support millions of users and games with high efficiency and security.

## Core Requirements
1. **Cross-Chain Gameplay**: Users  Users on different chains (e.g., Ethereum, XRPL) play via gateway contracts that communicate with the main dApp on Avalanche using Axelar’s GMP.
2. **Token Handling**: Accept fees in users’ native tokens, convert them on Avalanche into a predefined, community-voted set of tokens (e.g., AVAX, stablecoins, or others) for escrow.
3. **Payout Mechanism**: Winners receive payouts in their preferred token on their chain, facilitated by Axelar transferring wrapped tokens from Avalanche.
4. **Escrow System**: Collect fees, convert them into community-voted tokens, store them in an escrow account on Avalanche, and distribute periodically based on total games played.
5. **Scalability & Security**: Optimize for high transaction volumes, minimize gas costs on Avalanche, and ensure robust security through audits and best practices.

## Target Users
- Blockchain gamers across multiple chains seeking a seamless, cross-chain gaming experience.
- Users on ecosystems like XRPL, Ethereum, etc., who prefer using their native tokens for gameplay.
- Community members interested in voting on escrow token preferences and earning participation rewards.
- Developers and enterprises exploring scalable, cross-chain dApp solutions.

## Key Features
- **Cross-Chain Interaction**: Play rock-paper-scissors from any Axelar-supported chain using native tokens.
- **Flexible Payments**: Pay fees in native chain tokens, converted by the dApp into community-voted escrow tokens.
- **Custom Payouts**: Receive winnings in the user’s preferred token on their chain via Axelar.
- **Escrow Incentives**: Earn periodic rewards from a community-voted token pool based on participation.
- **Enterprise-Ready**: Built on Avalanche for speed and scalability, with Axelar enabling broad blockchain connectivity.

## Initial Tech Stack Considerations
- **Blockchain**: Avalanche (main dApp), with Axelar for cross-chain messaging.
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity for Avalanche deployment; gateway contracts on supported chains.
- **Development Tools**: Hardhat for smart contract development, testing, and deployment.
- **Cross-Chain Integration**: Axelar SDK and Axelar Interchain Token Service (ITS) for cross-chain messaging and token transfers.
- **Blockchain Interaction**: Web3.js or Ethers.js for interacting with Avalanche and other chains; XRPL.js for XRP Ledger integration.
- **Frontend**: Next.js for the web interface, styled with Tailwind CSS; Socket.io for real-time game updates.
- **Wallet Integration**: MetaMask SDK for user wallet connectivity.
- **Data Validation**: Zod for runtime type checking and validation.
- **Oracle**: Chainlink Oracle for secure off-chain data (e.g., random number generation for game outcomes).
- **Infrastructure**: Cloudflare for CDN and DDoS protection; Vercel for frontend deployment; Supabase for backend database and authentication; Clerk for user authentication and management.
- **Analytics & Monitoring**: Posthog for product analytics; Sentry for error tracking.
- **Version Control**: GitHub for source code management.

## Project Scope
The initial scope focuses on deploying the core game logic on Avalanche, integrating Axelar for cross-chain gameplay, implementing token conversion and escrow mechanics, and testing on Avalanche’s testnet. Future iterations may expand supported chains, refine the community voting process for escrow tokens, and develop a user-friendly frontend.
